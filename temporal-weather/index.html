        <h3>How to read this chart...</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Average daily temperature is represented along the x-axis. Each circle represents the average
                    temperature of a single day of a year.</li>
                <li>Data for Hordaland weather was collected over a 10-year period; the years of collection are
                    arranged along the y-axis. This in effect creates a set of temperature bands, which allow us to
                    see outliers in average temperature within and over the entire collection span.</li>
                <li>Daily temperature circles are color-coded to show type of precipitation on that day. Colors
                    represent the following precipitation types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Off-white: ND</li>
                        <li>Dark orange: RR</li>
                        <li>Light blue: RS</li>
                        <li>Dark blue: SS</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can see from this color scheme that there is mostly no data collected over this period, except
                    for the first few years of the collection.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to read this chart...</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Years form the outermost circle -- select one of these years to view the daily average
                        temperature and precipitation (mm) for each day of the calendar year.</li>
                    <li>Average temperature is shown as a small colored dot positioned along the circle axis to
                        indicate mean temperature for that day. </li>
                    <li>Precipitation is encoded with area, indicated by a circle with its center oriented with its
                        associated daily temperature bar. The larger the circle, the greater the amount of
                        precipitation
                        for
                        that day.</li>
                </ul>
